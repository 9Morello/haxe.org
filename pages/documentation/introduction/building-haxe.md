Building Haxe from source
=======

The Haxe compiler source files are hosted on GitHub under the HaxeFoundation account:

* The Haxe compiler sources: <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe>

Since the compiler sources changes over time, the documentation on how to build the compiler is part of the repository:

 * Building Haxe from source: <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/blob/development/extra/BUILDING.md>

 This document includes how to set up OCaml, install the dependencies and how to compile the compiler.
