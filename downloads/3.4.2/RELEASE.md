On behalf of the Haxe Foundation I am proud to announce that Haxe 3.4.2 is now officially released! It is available along with the changelog at https://haxe.org/download.

This is a bugfix release for various minor issues that showed up in 3.4.1.

Please test your Haxe code with this version and let us know if you come across any problems at https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues.

Thank you for your support
