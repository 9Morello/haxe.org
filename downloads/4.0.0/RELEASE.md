Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation, we are proud to announce the official release of the Haxe 4.0.0! 

We have worked for almost two years on this version. We shipped 5 preview and 5 release candidate versions, each with new and improved features and bugfixes and we have now reached a point where we can present a stable release!
