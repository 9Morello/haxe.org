Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation, we are proud to announce the official release of the Haxe 4.0.0! It is available along with the changelog at https://haxe.org/download.

We focused on bugfixes since 4.0.0-rc.5 and now think that we have reached a point where we can make a stable release.

See the changelog below for further details. Please report any issues here: <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues>

Thank you very much for your help!
