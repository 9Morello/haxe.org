This is a Haxe 4 preview release for the Haxe Summit 2017 in Amsterdam.

As a preview release, it should not be considered stable and does, in fact, have some known issues. However, we appreciate anyone testing this version as it is going to ultimately help with the real Haxe 4 release. Please report issues at https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues.
