Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation, we are proud to announce the official release of the Haxe 4.0.0-rc.1! It is available along with the changelog at https://haxe.org/download.

The main new feature of this release is an experimental null-checker, which can be enabled for individual packages from command line by using `--macro nullSafety("package.path")`. We will post more information on this soon!

See the changelog below for further details. Please report any issues here: <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues>

Thank you very much for your help!
