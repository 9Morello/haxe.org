Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation I am proud to announce that Haxe 3.4.4 is now officially released! It is available along with the changelog at <https://haxe.org/download>.

This release addresses a problem with the Flash target output that would cause invalid .swf files to be generated.

Please test your Haxe code with this version and let us know if you come across any problems at <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues>.

Thank you for your support
