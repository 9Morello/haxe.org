Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation, we are proud to announce the official release of the Haxe 4.0.0-rc.2! It is available along with the changelog at https://haxe.org/download.

We now support ES6 generation by using the `-D es=6` flag! Please test this with your Haxe/JavaScript codebases and let us know about any problems you come across.

Other than that, we fixed a lot of bugs and improved the quality of our error messages a little.

See the changelog below for further details. Please report any issues here: <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues>

Thank you very much for your help!
