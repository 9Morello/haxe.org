Dear community,

We hope you are enjoying the holidays.

Here is our new RC right on time for Christmas gift unwrapping. Though it contains mainly bugfixes, the new php target slipped in since it was not ready for the last RC.

Enjoy unpacking it!

Happy testing, issue reporting and Christmas to all of you!
