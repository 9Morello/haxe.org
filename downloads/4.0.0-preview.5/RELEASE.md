Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation, we are proud to announce the official release of the Haxe 4.0.0-preview.5! It is available along with the changelog at https://haxe.org/download.

As a preview release, it should not be considered stable. However, we appreciate anyone testing this version which will help us with the real Haxe 4 release. Please report any issues here:

Thank you very much for your help!
