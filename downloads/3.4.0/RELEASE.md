Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation I am proud to announce that Haxe 3.4.0 is now officially released! It is available along with the changelog at https://haxe.org/download.

We focused on bugfixes since 3.4.0-rc.2 and now think that we have reached a point where we can make a stable release.

Please test your Haxe code with this version and let us know if you come across any problems at https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues.

Thank you for your support
