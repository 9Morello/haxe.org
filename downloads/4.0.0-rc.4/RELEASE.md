Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation, we are proud to announce the official release of the Haxe 4.0.0-rc.4! It is available along with the changelog at https://haxe.org/download.

Our focus was on small bugfixes and internal stability. In particular, we made an effort to improve the integrity and memory usage of the compilation server. There were also a lot of changes to make IDE support even better.

There are still some issues to sort out before we declare Haxe to be ready for 4.0. We are getting closer, though! Your help in testing this release is, as always, greatly appreciated.

See the changelog below for further details. Please report any issues here: <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues>

Thank you very much for your help!
