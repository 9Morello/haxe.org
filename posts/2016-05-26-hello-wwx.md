Finding your way around Paris and coordinating things for WWX is not always easy so I thought it might help to give you some last-minute information.

## The #WWX2016 Tag

The easiest way to stay in contact, get up to date information and know what is happening is to keep an eye on the official WWX 2016 tag on twitter. A lot of things are being communicated short term. It is also a great way to get questions answered quickly and organize spontaneous meetups in the evening.

## The Metro Station

The Mozilla building is located on 16 Boulevard Montmartre, right in the city centre. The closest metro station is "Richelieu - Drouot" and serves lines 8 and 9. It will drop you almost in front of the door. Another good option is "Opera" serving lines 3, 7 and 8.

Here is a link to the full [Metro Plan](http://www.ratp.fr/informer/pdf/orienter/f_plan.php).

You can buy a bunch of tickets at a time and then use them one by one. That way, you don't have to stop by the counter every time you take the metro.


## Meeting Up

During the day, the best place to meet and check in is the Mozilla building. There will be a doorman so you should have no trouble getting in. If you encounter any problems, you send a call for help on twitter.

## The Friday Dinner

The plans for the welcome dinner are still in the making. Please keep an eye on the twitter stream for last minute announcements. I am sure we will find somewhere nice to meet up.

See you soon!
