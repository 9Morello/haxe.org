On behalf of my team at FlowPlay, along with the Haxe Foundation, we are excited to welcome everyone to Seattle next month for the inaugural U.S. Haxe Summit! We have some great sessions and workshops planned on a collection of topics including several introductory workshops that take developers through the basics of Haxe to in-depth advanced sessions that dive into real-world use cases. Alongside being tasked with choosing which discussions make it on your must-attend list, another important thing to consider is learning about the city you&#39;re visiting. To make things easier, let me provide you with a quick overview to help you find your way around before even stepping off the plane.

Better known as the Emerald City, Seattle is a treasure trove of activities, sights to see, world-class restaurants, and a rock star music scene. From the historic Pike Place Market to the iconic Space Needle, there&#39;s plenty to do when you get a chance to slip away from a session or workshop or if you decide to spend your night exploring the city before attending our evening parties. Below are four of my tips to help plan your trip and navigate your visit:

## Finding Your Home During the Event

In case you haven&#39;t taken advantage of our discounted rate at The Hilton Downtown Seattle (make sure to check it out before it runs out!), there are several other hotel options close to the center of the city. But if you&#39;re feeling a little adventurous, book your stay through a site like Airbnb and check out one of Seattle&#39;s many neighborhoods like Queen Anne, Capitol Hill, or Belltown. No matter what option you choose, there are several quick ways to get to and from the venue.

## Ridesharing, Lightrail, or Walking – You Decide!

There are several ways to get around Seattle so before grabbing an Uber, Lyft or cab, here are a few other modes to consider. Your first option to walk and see the city by foot – there are a lot of great places to stop and check out along the way! Another option would be to use one of our several bike sharing services like [ofo](https://www.ofo.com/us/en), [Limebike](http://www.limebike.com/), and Spin to get around quicker while still taking in the sights. So if you see a bike on the roadside, feel free to hop on and take a spin around downtown. Fair warning that the hills can be brutal via bike, however.

If you&#39;re looking to get around like a true Seattleite, take a ride on the Link lightrail. It typically runs around every 6-10 minutes, is available between 5am and 1am, is a budget-friendly option to get into the city from SeaTac airport, and there&#39;s even a station located in Westlake Center just three blocks up from the Seattle Hilton. You can access the daily schedule and route [here](https://m.soundtransit.org/schedule).

## Make Time for Sightseeing

Seattle is filled with exciting landmarks like the Space Needle and Pike Place Market to natural beauty like the Puget Sound and Mount Rainier. If heading to Pike Place Market, you&#39;ll be able to see another one of our city&#39;s iconic sights, the gum wall, and gain quick access to the beautiful waterfront where you can take a ride on the [Great Wheel](http://seattlegreatwheel.com/) for a spectacular view of the city. The Space Needle, Columbia Tower, and Discovery Park are a few other great options to experience the fantastic views. And if your schedule allows for it, make sure to check out the Seattle music scene and catch an evening show at [The Showbox](http://www.showboxpresents.com/), [The Crocodile](https://www.thecrocodile.com/), or [Highway 99 Blues Club](http://www.highwayninetynine.com/). You won&#39;t be disappointed!

## Grabbing a Bite to Eat

The Pacific Northwest is known for its coastal cuisine and there are great finds throughout the city from well-known restauranteurs to delicious hole in the wall eateries. After walking through Pike Place Market, you will find [Seatown Seabar](https://www.seatownrestaurant.com/) and [Etta&#39;s](https://www.ettasrestaurant.com/), two of James Beard award winner Tom Douglas&#39; restaurants, or make your way down to the waterfront to visit the Crab Pot. Make sure to bring a few friends with you, though, to enjoy one in their famous Seafeasts – eating bibs are included! If seafood is not on your list, try one of our many other restaurants from cuisines around the world like [Radiator Whisky](http://www.radiatorwhiskey.com/), [Steelhead Diner](http://steelheaddiner.com/), [Dahlia Lounge](https://www.dahlialounge.com/), [The Brooklyn](http://www.thebrooklyn.com/), and [Vons 1000 Spirits](http://www.vons1000spirits.com/).

Seattle is also known for it&#39;s craft beer scene. [Pike Brewing](https://www.pikebrewing.com/) is a great place to sample from a couple of dozen beers on tap and get a great burger. [Elysian Bar](http://elysianbrewing.com/locations/elysian-bar.html) is close to the conference venue and has great drinks and food. [Old Stove Brewing](https://www.oldstove.com/) is another small place with bold fresh brewed beers and good snacks.

Although we&#39;re still a month away, we are counting down the days until the Summit. It&#39;s great to be able to bring the Haxe community together in the U.S. for the first time to discuss the future of the technology and its innovative use cases, and we&#39;re excited to show off the Pacific Northwest beauty and culture while you&#39;re here. See you in May!
