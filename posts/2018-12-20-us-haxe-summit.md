Haxians!

Last year we had our first US Haxe Summit. We met up, saw who else uses Haxe over there and found people to connect with who were, if not from close by, at least not from “a continent away”. We (FlowPlay and the Haxe Foundation) agreed that it was a great thing to do and that we should do it again.

Thus, I am delighted to announce more details of our second US Summit:

**Date:** 8th - 10th of May 2019

**Location:** [Bell Harbor International Conference Center](https://goo.gl/maps/xaDGa16fD4L2)

**Accomodation:** There is a hotel which shares a driveway with the conference venue. Once we have an idea about the demand, we will reserve some rooms and see if we can get a special deal.

**Price:** The early bird tickets will be priced around 299 USD, the full price for a later booking will be 399 USD. A ticket link for early bird pricing should be available soon. Speakers will get a free pass.

**Travel:** If you need a visa, please make sure to apply early enough. We will be happy to send you a signed and stamped letter for visa application purposes.


The speaker schedule, the social events, and other details are still in the works so here is what to do in the meantime:
