# class HaxeFoundation extends Manpower

The Haxe Foundation is proud to announce that [Alexander Kuzmenko](https://github.com/realyuniquename) will be working for us full-time starting right now! Alexander has been a member of the community for many years and has already made awesome contributions, like the [new PHP target](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/5845) and the [null-safety](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/7717) feature. We are excited to have his support on our quest towards Haxe 4 and beyond!

Furthermore, [Aurel Bily](https://github.com/Aurel300) is joining us as an intern for 6 months. He will be working on various projects, for instance an asynchronous sys-API. We are looking forward to the results of his internship!

The Haxe future is looking very bright. There are going to be more exciting news coming soon, so stay tuned!

P.S.: You can meet Alexander at the Seattle [Haxe Summit](https://summit.haxe.org/us/2019/) next month.
