## Haxe Summit 2018 Recap

The first Haxe U.S summit has come and gone but it won’t be soon forgotten.  Themes of inspiration and cooperation dominated the 3-day event as Haxe users from around the World gathered to share their work and ideas.  Along with talks and workshops, there were plenty of festivities including a casino night, tour of Summit sponsor FlowPlay’s offices and a trip to the top of the Smith tower.  Here are some of key highlights from the event.

## Inspired by the Inspirational

Longtime Haxe community advocate <a href="https://twitter.com/Fiene_P/">Josefiene Pertosa</a> kicked off the Summit with a speech that focused on the core theme of inspiration.  This, along with her closing address definitely motivated the crowd who engaged in lively, creative discussion throughout the conference.

You don’t need to wait for the release to try out these new features.  Many are available now in the <a href="https://haxe.org/download/version/4.0.0-preview.3/">latest preview build.</a>

## Haxe Foundation Improvements

Nicolas also discussed the new process for Haxe feature requests.  The goal is more transparency and community involvement and so far the reviews have been psoitive.

## New Haxe Foundation Marketing Director

Nicolas also introduced the Haxe community to the newest member of the Haxe Foundation, Marketing Director <a href="https://twitter.com/fishbulb_ca">Phil Chertok</a> (Me!)

I presented my ideas on how to grow the Haxe platform with a variety of suggestions involving community outreach and engagement programs.  Be sure to keep an eye out because there’s going to be a lot more activity from myself and the Haxe Foundation in the coming months.

## FlowPlay

Summit sponsor <a href="https://www.flowplay.com/">FlowPlay</a> had a variety of presentations that included topics ranging from their process of converting a million + lines of code to Haxe, Mobile Development Pitfalls, Advanced Project Management and Native Extension development.

FlowPlay also showed off their gorgeous offices and hosted an exciting Casino themed event where Haxe Summit attendees got to compete for prizes.

Thanks to Adam, Craig and Scott for their fantastic talks. 

## OpenFL 8.0 Released

<a href="http://openfl.org">OpenFL</a> Managing Director Joshua Granick used the Haxe Summit to announce the release of OpenFL 8.0.  Along with new performance features, Joshua revealed that OpenFL is now available on NPM for TypeScript & JavaScript users, expanding the reach of OpenFL to even more developers!

## Wait… there’s more

If that’s not enough Haxe Summit Seattle also featured great presentations on fabulous tools like <a href="https://github.com/back2dos">Juraj Kircheim’s</a> showcase of his package management solution <a href="https://github.com/back2dos/lix-hxcpp">Lix</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/omgjjd?lang=en">Justin Donaldson’s</a> wonderfully named routing utility <a href="https://github.com/jdonaldson/golgi">Golgi</a> and a series of talks on the suite of libraries from DoclerLabs called <a href="http://hexmachina.org/">hexMachina</a>. To round out the talks on tools, <a href="http://bishtonsoftwaresolutions.com/">Eric Bishton</a> reminded us all of the value of using the <a href="https://github.com/EricBishton/intellij-haxe">Haxe plugin for IntelliJ</a>, especially for large projects and enterprise developers. 

Longtime Haxe community contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/robdangerous">Robert Konrad</a> delivered a brilliant talk on cooperation in the Haxe world and followed that up with a great introductory session on working with <a href="http://kha.tech/">Kha.</a>

<a href="https://www.onthewings.net/">Andy Li</a> also held an beginners talk that gave new Haxe users a crash course in getting started with our favorite tool. 

<a href="https://thomasjwebb.com/#">Thomas J Webb</a> of <a href="https://osakared.io/">Osaka Red</a> had a pair of theoretical sessions, one on literate programming and another on the case for doing everything with Haxe. I don’t think you need to convince us Thomas!

What would a Haxe Summit be without game related content?  <a href="https://twitter.com/smerkyg">Dan Goldstein</a> of <a href="http://www.hyperawesome.com/">Hyper Awesome Entertainment</a> shared his experience getting <a href="http://www.dungeonpunksgame.com/">Dungeon Punks</a> on XBox, PS4, PS Vita and Steam.  Nicolas Cannasse returned to amaze the crowd with the capabilities of his new 2D & 3D game framework <a href="https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps">HEAPS</a>. Finally <a href="https://twitter.com/damoebius?lang=en">David Mouton</a> gave a fantastic playable demo of his interactive Haxe teaching game <a href="https://gitlab.com/damoebius/codeofwa">‘Code of War’</a> where you write a bot to conquer the galaxy, planet by planet.

Two of the funniest presentations came from long time Haxe community member <a href="http://jcward.com/">Jeff Ward</a> who’s meme generator produced an ocean of laughter.  If that wasn’t enough he also gave users insight into his preferred stack when developing web applications in Haxe.  Not to be outdone, <a href="https://www.confidant.ca/">Alan Dowdeswell</a> hilariously shared his story of how he discovered Haxe and has been using it for his interactive applications.  He also showed us his Haxe themed license plate which every member of the audience wanted!

## Until Next Time

Looking back, the first ever Haxe US Summit was a huge success.  It wouldn’t have been possible without the tremendous support from our sponsor <a href="https://www.flowplay.com/">FlowPlay</a> and our fabulous attendees.  Preparations for the next summit are already underway & we look forward to sharing details with you as soon as possible.  Until then, thanks to everyone who took part online or in person and we can’t wait to see you all again.
