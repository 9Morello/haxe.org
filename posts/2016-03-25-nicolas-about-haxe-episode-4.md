After some sound issues involving Teletubby-like sounds and a whole choir of Nicolas, this week's stream went ahead successfully and the video is up:

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">

    </a>

If you want to have a look, you can find the Haxe Compiler Source at our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe).

Simon wrote an article explaining a lot of what Nicolas explained in the video so this week, I will just leave you with his story of [The Journey of Hello World Through the Haxe Compiler](https://haxe.org/blog/the-journey-of-hello-world-through-the-haxe-compiler-part-1/).

Enjoy!
