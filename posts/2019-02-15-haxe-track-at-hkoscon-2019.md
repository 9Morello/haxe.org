## The previous one in 2018 was great!

We did it for the first time to have a Haxe track at the annual [Hong Kong Open Source Conference](https://www.facebook.com/hkoscon/) (HKOSCon) for the last year. It was a success!

We had 2 talks, given by Jason O'Neil and Kevin Leung. Both talks happened to be web development related!

You can find the videos in [our video page](https://haxe.org/videos/conferences/hkoscon-2018-haxe-track/).

## Let's do it again in 2019!

For this year, we have applied again and have enrolled to the initial list of HKOSCon 2019 participating communities. To actually make it happen, we need to have at least 2 talks.

Now, we are calling on you to be our speakers. We welcome any Haxe-related topics such as the sharing of Haxe programming techniques, libraries and frameworks, or showcases of games/websites/apps built with Haxe.

The tentative date of the conference is 14-15 June 2019 (Fri-Sat). The venue is to be confirmed (in Hong Kong for sure).

To submit a proposal, please fill out [this form](http://hkoscon.org/2019/cfp/) on or before 25 February 2019.

# Update (2019-04-04):

I'm happy to announce that we have [2 talks accepted by the HKOSCon Program Committee](https://hkoscon.org/2019/topics/):

 1. "Haxe transpilation to PHP: static typing, arrow functions, metaprogramming and more", by Aleksandr Kuzmenko, who [just became HF's full-time compiler dev](https://haxe.org/blog/haxe-foundation-extends-manpower/)!

 2. "Whatâ€™s new in Haxe 4", by Andy Li (yeah, that's me).

The conference venue has been finalized to be Hong Kong Science Park. Both talks will be given on 15/6 (Sat) afternoon. We look forward to seeing you there!
