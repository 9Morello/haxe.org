We have been working on a new website which went live today: the Haxe Code Cookbook. It has categorized code snippets with additional explanations; small code tutorials and examples in a central place.

> The Haxe Code Cookbook can be found here:  
> <http://code.haxe.org/>

There is also a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/code-cookbook/). The website is powered by pull requests so it is easy to add new content. Everyone with a GitHub account can contribute by putting markdown formatted files in one of the category-folders we've created, or suggest a new one.
The site is generated with Haxe (of course) and with an automatic process (using Travis) new snippets will go live immediately after being reviewed.

We hope this will grow into a useful central world with Haxe coding snippets and tutorials!
